# Mini Reworks

The mini consoles that have been released so far have been great, but not all of them have been hacked, their roms ripped and classified in the regular fashion in the hardware target game database. 
As most of the games are already available in previous releases, it is trivial to build a collection for the mini using those releases. 
Presumably, as those consoles get hacked, these files will become obsolete, but in the mean time, they can be a nice way to have the collection in your gaming setup.

Systems available:
	Mega drive Mini 2.
	
	TurboGrafx/PcEngine Mini
